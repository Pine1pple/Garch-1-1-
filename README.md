Bitcoin Volatility Analysis
This project analyzes the volatility of Bitcoin prices using a GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model. It includes visualization of Bitcoin closing prices, log returns, and autocorrelation of log returns. Additionally, it fits a GARCH(1,1) model to the data to predict future volatility.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
arch

Usage

Ensure you have a CSV file containing Bitcoin price data with columns for Date and Close price.
Update the file_path variable in the script with the path to your Bitcoin price data CSV file.
Run the script. This will:
Load the Bitcoin price data into a pandas DataFrame.
Visualize Bitcoin closing prices over time.
Display summary statistics of the data.
